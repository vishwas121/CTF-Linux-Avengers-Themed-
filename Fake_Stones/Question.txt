To protect the infinity stones Thanos used the Reality stone to create the fake duplicates of the stone.
Now only avengers can "locate" these stones. They are hidden somewhere in one of these folders.
But since the half of the avengers are dead they don't have enough people to search each and every folder.
Please assist the avengers in finding something different in these folders other than the fake flag.
